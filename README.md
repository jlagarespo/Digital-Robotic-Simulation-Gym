# Digital Robotic Simulation Gym Space
## A microcontroller simulator inside the computer in python

This system was designed to simulate a microcontroller what recives orders and then executes them(like move up, move right etc.).
This allows us to test complex AI algorythms without a real robot, such as simple programmed algorythms(look at the examples
directory) to complex mathematical solutions to certain problems in the agent behaviour.

*stuff what needs to be writed by the notes we have in the real world
